# Biggest-circle
currently does nothing
intent is to take an .igc tracklog test if it is "closed" (proximity of initial point to final point is within 20% of calculated circle circumfrence)
then calculate the largest circle enclosed by the tracklog.
reason: to score local paragliding flights and award a silly prize for whoever does the largest diameter flight of the year.
